# 🟢 GitHub-Hosted (Default) Runners

✅ **Pros**

* **Zero setup** → ready to use (`runs-on: ubuntu-latest` etc.)
* **Always updated** → latest OS, tools, runtimes pre-installed
* **Security isolation** → each job runs in a clean VM, no leftovers from previous runs
* **No infra management** → GitHub handles scaling, patching, maintenance
* **Free minutes** (depending on your plan — Free, Pro, Team, Enterprise)

❌ **Cons**

* Limited runtime (max 6 hours per job)
* Limited compute (2-core CPU, 7GB RAM, 14GB SSD for free runners)
* Cold start (1–2 minutes to boot VM)
* Cannot access **private networks, internal systems, or custom hardware**
* Costly if you need lots of build minutes on paid plan

# 🟡 Self-Hosted Runners

✅ **Pros**

* Full **control** → choose OS, hardware size, software installed
* Can access **private resources** (databases, APIs inside VPC, on-prem servers, etc.)
* Better **performance** if you use powerful machines (faster builds, caching)
* **No per-minute billing** from GitHub (you just pay AWS/infra cost)
* Can run **long jobs** beyond GitHub’s limits

❌ **Cons**

* **You manage everything** → updates, patches, scaling, security
* Security risk → jobs can run arbitrary code from your repo (don’t expose to untrusted workflows)
* Needs monitoring (runner going offline = builds stuck)
* Can become a bottleneck if only 1 runner and multiple jobs queue up

# 📝 When to Choose Which?

### Use **GitHub-hosted runners** if:

* You’re just starting out
* Builds/tests are light/medium workloads
* You don’t need access to internal/private infra
* You want **no-maintenance CI/CD**

### Use **Self-hosted runners** if:

* You need **fast builds** (big CPUs, GPUs, custom hardware)
* You need **private VPC / on-prem access**
* You run **very long jobs** (training ML models, data pipelines)
* You want to save costs by reusing **existing infra** (EC2, Kubernetes, on-prem servers)

---

# ⚡ Best of Both Worlds

Many companies use a **hybrid model**:

* Default GitHub runners for lightweight, general jobs (linting, unit tests)
* Self-hosted runners for **heavy builds** (Docker, ML training, GPU workloads, private system access)
